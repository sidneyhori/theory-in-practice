        <h2>Shortcuts That Mislead</h2>
        <p>
          Our brains evolved to make quick decisions with limited information. These mental
          shortcuts&mdash;heuristics&mdash;usually work well enough. But they also create
          predictable errors called <strong>cognitive biases</strong>. Understanding these
          biases helps us think more clearly and make better decisions.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <p class="callout-title">Why Biases Exist</p>
          <p>
            Evolution optimized our brains for survival, not truth. Fast, approximate thinking
            that's occasionally wrong beats slow, accurate thinking that gets you eaten. Our
            ancestors who jumped at shadows survived more often than those who carefully
            analyzed whether that rustle was a predator.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          Cognitive biases aren't random mistakes&mdash;they're systematic patterns. The same
          bias affects most people in similar ways. This predictability means we can study
          them scientifically and, with effort, partially counteract them.

      <!-- Framing Effect Section -->
      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>The Framing Effect</h2>

        <p>
          The same information can lead to different decisions depending on how it's presented.
          "90% survival rate" sounds better than "10% mortality rate"&mdash;even though they're
          identical. Our brains process gains and losses differently.
        </p>

        <p>
          Framing affects everything from medical decisions to consumer choices. Marketers
          exploit this constantly: "95% fat-free" sells better than "5% fat." Being aware
          of framing helps you focus on the actual information rather than its packaging.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <p class="callout-title">Loss Aversion</p>
          <p>
            Losses loom larger than gains. Losing $100 feels worse than gaining $100 feels
            good&mdash;by about 2x according to research. This asymmetry means negative frames
            are often more powerful than positive ones. Fear of loss motivates more than
            hope of gain.

      <!-- Confirmation Bias Section -->
      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Confirmation Bias</h2>

        <p>
          We seek out information that confirms what we already believe and ignore or
          dismiss evidence that contradicts it. This isn't conscious dishonesty&mdash;it's
          automatic. We genuinely find confirming evidence more compelling and memorable.
        </p>

        <p>
          Confirmation bias explains why debates rarely change minds. Each side sees the
          same evidence as supporting their position. It's why first impressions are so
          sticky, why stereotypes persist, and why smart people can believe false things.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <p class="callout-title">The Backfire Effect</p>
          <p>
            Sometimes correcting misinformation makes people believe it more strongly.
            Challenging core beliefs can feel like a personal attack, triggering defensive
            reasoning. The most effective way to change minds is usually indirect&mdash;
            asking questions rather than presenting contradicting evidence.

      <!-- Other Biases Section -->
      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>More Common Biases</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Availability Heuristic:</strong> We judge probability by how easily examples
          come to mind. Plane crashes feel more likely than car crashes because they're more
          memorable, even though cars are far more dangerous.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Hindsight Bias:</strong> After something happens, we feel we "knew it all
          along." This makes us overconfident in our predictive abilities and prevents us
          from learning from surprises.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Dunning-Kruger Effect:</strong> The less you know, the more you overestimate
          your knowledge. Experts doubt themselves; novices are confident. True competence
          brings awareness of how much you don't know.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <p class="callout-title">Bias Blind Spot</p>
          <p>
            The most meta bias: we see biases in others but not in ourselves. Even knowing
            about biases doesn't make us immune. The best defense is building systems and
            habits that counteract bias, rather than trusting our ability to think clearly
            in the moment.

        <h2>Key Insights</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Biases are universal.</strong> They're not signs of stupidity&mdash;they're
          features of how human cognition works. Smart people are just as susceptible, sometimes
          more so because they're better at rationalizing.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Awareness isn't enough.</strong> Knowing about biases doesn't prevent them.
          You need explicit debiasing techniques: consider alternatives, seek disconfirming
          evidence, use checklists, get outside perspectives.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Systems beat willpower.</strong> Instead of trying to think better in the
          moment, design environments and processes that reduce bias. Blind review processes,
          pre-commitment strategies, and diverse teams all help.
