        <h2>The Magic of Compounding</h2>
        <p>
          Einstein allegedly called compound interest the "eighth wonder of the world." Whether
          or not he said it, the principle is profound: when growth builds on itself, small
          rates create massive outcomes given enough time. A penny that doubles every day for
          a month becomes over $10 million.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <p class="callout-title">Linear vs Exponential</p>
          <p>
            Linear growth adds a fixed amount each period. Exponential growth multiplies by a
            fixed rate. The difference is dramatic: add $100/year for 30 years and you have
            $3,000. Grow $100 at 10%/year for 30 years and you have $1,745. The percentage
            wins despite looking smaller at first.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          Compounding applies everywhere: investment returns, skill development, relationship
          building, knowledge acquisition. Understanding exponential growth&mdash;and its
          counterpart, exponential decay&mdash;is essential for long-term thinking.

      <!-- Rule of 72 Section -->
      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>The Rule of 72</h2>

        <p>
          Want to know how long until your money doubles? Divide 72 by the interest rate. At
          7% growth, your money doubles in about 10 years (72 &divide; 7 &approx; 10). At 12%,
          it doubles in 6 years. This simple rule gives surprisingly accurate estimates.
        </p>

        <p>
          The rule works because ln(2) &approx; 0.693, and 72 is close to 69.3 while being
          conveniently divisible by many numbers. It's a mental math shortcut that investors
          and financial planners use constantly.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <p class="callout-title">The Flip Side</p>
          <p>
            The Rule of 72 also works for decay. If inflation is 3%, prices double every 24
            years. If a currency depreciates at 6%, it loses half its value in 12 years.
            Understanding exponential decay is just as important as understanding growth.

        <h2>Small Differences, Big Outcomes</h2>

        <p>
          A 1% difference in returns might not seem like much, but over decades it's enormous.
          $10,000 growing at 7% for 30 years becomes $76,000. At 8%, it becomes $100,000. That
          single percentage point difference is $24,000&mdash;more than twice the original
          investment.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is why fees matter so much in investing. A fund with 1% higher fees might seem
          similar to a cheaper alternative, but over a career of investing, that 1% could cost
          you hundreds of thousands of dollars.

          <p class="callout-title">The Patience Tax</p>
          <p>
            Compounding rewards patience and punishes impatience. If you withdraw 10% of your
            gains each year instead of reinvesting them, your long-term wealth is dramatically
            reduced. The real power of compounding only emerges when you leave the money alone
            to grow.

        <h2>Compounding Everywhere</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Investing:</strong> Starting early matters more than starting big. Someone
          who invests $5,000/year from age 25-35 (10 years) will have more at 65 than someone
          who invests $5,000/year from 35-65 (30 years), at the same rate. Time beats money.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Skills:</strong> Getting 1% better at something each day means you're 37
          times better after a year. Knowledge compounds too&mdash;what you learn today makes
          tomorrow's learning easier. This is why consistent practice beats occasional cramming.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Relationships:</strong> Small acts of kindness compound into deep
          relationships. Small acts of neglect compound into distance. The daily choices
          matter more than the grand gestures.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <p class="callout-title">Negative Compounding</p>
          <p>
            Debt compounds against you. Credit card debt at 20% interest doubles in under 4
            years. This is why paying off high-interest debt is often the best "investment"
            you can make&mdash;it's a guaranteed return equal to the interest rate.

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Key Insights</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Time is the biggest factor.</strong> Starting early is more powerful than
          starting with more money. A 20-year-old investing $100/month will likely beat a
          40-year-old investing $500/month by retirement.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Small rates matter.</strong> A 1% difference seems trivial but compounds
          into enormous differences. Minimize fees, maximize returns, and be patient.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Compounding works both ways.</strong> It builds wealth when you save and
          destroys it when you borrow. Understanding this asymmetry is financially crucial.
