        <h2>What is Chaos Theory?</h2>
        <p>
          Chaos theory studies systems where small differences in starting conditions lead to vastly
          different outcomes. These systems follow precise rules&mdash;they're not random&mdash;yet
          they're impossible to predict long-term because tiny measurement errors get amplified exponentially.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <p class="callout-title">The Butterfly Effect</p>
          <p>
            Meteorologist Edward Lorenz discovered chaos in 1961 when he reran a weather simulation.
            He entered 0.506 instead of 0.506127, thinking the tiny difference wouldn't matter. Instead,
            the weather patterns diverged completely. He later asked: "Does the flap of a butterfly's
            wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?"
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          Chaos isn't randomness&mdash;it's deterministic unpredictability. The system follows exact rules,
          but we can never measure starting conditions precisely enough to predict far into the future.
          This limits weather forecasts, explains turbulence, and even affects your heartbeat.

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Chaos in the Real World</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Weather:</strong> This is why forecasts beyond about 10 days are unreliable. The atmosphere
          is chaotic&mdash;we'd need to measure every air molecule's position to predict perfectly. Modern
          forecasters run many simulations with slightly different starting conditions to see how predictions diverge.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>The Stock Market:</strong> Financial markets show chaotic behavior. Small events can trigger
          cascading effects, making long-term predictions impossible despite sophisticated models. This is why
          no one consistently beats the market.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Your Heart:</strong> A healthy heartbeat isn't perfectly regular&mdash;it's chaotically
          variable. Paradoxically, a too-regular heartbeat can signal problems. The heart operates near
          the "edge of chaos," giving it flexibility to respond to changing demands.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <p class="callout-title">The Lorenz Attractor</p>
          <p>
            Lorenz's weather equations produce a beautiful butterfly-shaped pattern called a "strange attractor."
            The system orbits this shape forever but never exactly repeats its path. It's deterministic
            yet unpredictable&mdash;the signature of chaos.

        <h2>Understanding Chaos</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Lyapunov Exponents:</strong> These measure how fast nearby trajectories separate.
          A positive exponent means chaos&mdash;errors grow exponentially. Weather has positive
          Lyapunov exponents, which is why we can't predict it beyond about two weeks.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Period Doubling:</strong> Many systems enter chaos through a specific route.
          As a parameter changes, the system goes from one stable state, to oscillating between two,
          then four, then eight... until suddenly it's chaotic. This pattern is universal.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Order Within Chaos:</strong> Strange attractors show that even chaotic systems have
          structure. They're confined to specific regions of possibility, even though the exact path
          is unpredictable. Weather is chaotic, but Earth never becomes Venus.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <p class="callout-title">The Edge of Chaos</p>
          <p>
            Many complex systems operate at the "edge of chaos"&mdash;not fully ordered, not fully chaotic.
            This sweet spot allows both stability and adaptability. Life, ecosystems, and markets all
            seem to self-organize near this critical boundary.

      <!-- Takeaways Section -->
      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Key Insights</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Unpredictability isn't randomness.</strong> Chaotic systems follow exact rules,
          but we can never know initial conditions precisely enough. This is a fundamental limit,
          not a lack of computing power or knowledge.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Small causes can have big effects.</strong> In chaotic systems, tiny differences
          get amplified. This explains why weather forecasts fail, why markets crash unexpectedly,
          and why history hinges on seemingly minor events.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Long-term prediction has limits.</strong> No matter how good our models get,
          some systems are fundamentally unpredictable beyond a certain horizon. Recognizing this
          limit is itself valuable knowledge.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <p class="callout-title">Where This Applies</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Planning:</strong> Build resilience rather than trying to predict everything.
            <strong>Science:</strong> Understand why some phenomena resist precise prediction.
            <strong>Finance:</strong> Respect the limits of forecasting and diversify.
            <strong>Life:</strong> Small actions can have outsized long-term consequences.
