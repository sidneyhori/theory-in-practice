        <h2>What is Graph Theory?</h2>
        <p>
          Graph theory is the study of networks&mdash;collections of things (called nodes or vertices)
          and the connections between them (called edges). Despite the name, it has nothing to do with
          bar charts or line graphs. Instead, it's about understanding relationships and connections.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <p class="callout-title">The Bridges of K&ouml;nigsberg</p>
          <p>
            In 1736, mathematician Leonhard Euler solved a famous puzzle: Can you walk through the city
            of K&ouml;nigsberg crossing each of its seven bridges exactly once? By abstracting the problem
            into nodes (land masses) and edges (bridges), Euler proved it was impossible&mdash;and invented
            graph theory in the process.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          You encounter graphs constantly without realizing it. Your social network is a graph where
          people are nodes and friendships are edges. The internet is a graph of connected computers.
          Roads connecting cities, neurons in your brain, even the structure of molecules&mdash;all graphs.

      <!-- Real-World Examples Section -->
      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Graph Theory in the Real World</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>GPS Navigation:</strong> When Google Maps finds the fastest route, it's solving a graph
          problem. Intersections are nodes, roads are edges (with weights for time/distance), and algorithms
          like Dijkstra's find the shortest path. This same math powers logistics companies routing
          thousands of packages daily.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Social Networks:</strong> Facebook's "People You May Know" feature uses graph analysis.
          If you share many mutual friends with someone, you're likely to know them. The "six degrees of
          separation" theory says any two people are connected by at most six friendship links&mdash;a
          property of how social graphs are structured.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Recommendation Engines:</strong> Netflix and Spotify model users and content as a graph.
          If users who liked A also liked B, there's probably a connection. These graphs help predict
          what you'll enjoy based on patterns from millions of users.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <p class="callout-title">PageRank</p>
          <p>
            Google's original algorithm treated the web as a graph where pages are nodes and hyperlinks
            are edges. Pages that receive many links from important pages are themselves important. This
            recursive definition revolutionized search and made Google a trillion-dollar company.

        <h2>Key Concepts</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Degree:</strong> The number of edges connected to a node. In a social network,
          your degree is your friend count. Highly connected nodes (high degree) are often influential&mdash;
          think celebrities or news outlets.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Connected Components:</strong> Groups of nodes where you can reach any node from any other
          within the group. If your social network has two separate friend groups with no mutual connections,
          those are two components.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Shortest Path:</strong> The minimum number of edges (or minimum total weight) to get from
          one node to another. This concept underlies routing algorithms, from GPS to network packets.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <p class="callout-title">The Small World Phenomenon</p>
          <p>
            Most real-world networks have surprisingly short paths between any two nodes. In social networks,
            this gives us "six degrees of separation." This happens because even a few random long-range
            connections dramatically shrink distances in a network&mdash;a discovery that explains why trends
            and information can spread so quickly.

      <!-- Takeaways Section -->
      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Key Insights</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Everything is connected.</strong> Once you see the world through graphs, you notice
          networks everywhere. Supply chains, disease spread, power grids, the web&mdash;all follow similar
          mathematical patterns despite being completely different systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Structure determines behavior.</strong> The shape of a network determines how information,
          diseases, or failures spread through it. Highly connected "hub" nodes make networks efficient but
          vulnerable&mdash;take out a hub and the whole system suffers.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Simple algorithms solve complex problems.</strong> Finding the shortest path through millions
          of nodes sounds impossibly complex, but algorithms like Dijkstra's and BFS solve it efficiently.
          The key insight: break the problem into small steps that guarantee progress.
        </p>

            <strong>Networking:</strong> Understanding how social and professional connections work.
            <strong>Logistics:</strong> Optimizing routes and supply chains.
            <strong>Problem Solving:</strong> Breaking complex relationships into nodes and edges.
